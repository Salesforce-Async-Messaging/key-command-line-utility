# Creating a Certificate

These instructions can help you create a certificate for testing purposes. For production, you should get your certificates from a trusted certificate authority.

> **Note**
> These instructions are for testing purposes ONLY!

## Generate Certificate and Private Key

The following command helps you generate a test certificate using a command from the OpenSSL toolkit. Replace `PrivateKeyFileName.key` with the filename you want to use for the private key and replace `PublicCertFileName.key` with the filename you want to use for the public certificate file.

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout PrivateKeyFileName.key -out PublicCertFileName.crt -sha256 -days 365
```

## Generate Public Key

The following command helps you generate a public key from the private key. Replace `PrivateKeyFileName.key` with the private key filename you created earlier. Replace `PublicKeyFileName.key` with the filename you want to use for the public key.

```
openssl rsa -in PrivateKeyFileName.key -pubout -out PublicKeyFileName.key
```

You can use the public certificate file and the keys generated by this command to create a JWK. To use our provided command line tool, see [JWT and JWK Command Line Utility](README.md).
